<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>Training Zone is seeking higher exposure of services to their target audience, to drive revenue increase.
    In essence, they are seeking a website designed to draw more customers into the fold by advertising the
    best content Training Zone has to offer, as well as building trust in the methods and staff members of
    Training Zone.
  </p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Success Evaulation for this site will be twofold. On one hand, changes in traffic to the website from one week
to the next will be recorded and a trend derived. The hope is that the longer the website is up, the more visitors it has.

  In order to also test whether visitors are turning into customers, and given the client has agreed to no changes in other
  advertising campaigns, we will also measure sales trends week to week, as well as customer numbers week to week.
  Given the website is the only variable, we assume that any increases can be attributed thereto.
</p>
